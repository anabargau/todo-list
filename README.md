# ToDo List
## What it does?
This is an app that lets you add projects that you are working on and tasks for each project that you created. Each tasks that you create has a title, description, due date and priority. You can view all the projects and choose the one you want to view from a selector, you can see al the tasks for each project with different colored borders for each priority, you can expand every task to see its description, delete any task or project, delete all the completed tasks and sort all the tasks by due date or priority ascending or descending. You can also check or uncheck any task off the list. All the tasks and projects are saved in local storage.
